# ft_containers

This project is a recreation of the C++ STL containers.
The goal of this project is to learn about the inner workings of the STL containers and to learn about the C++ language.

## Description

The project consists of 3 containers: vector, map and stack.

## Usage

To compile the project, run `make`.

to run my implementation of the STL containers, run `./test_ft`.

to run the same tests on the STL containers, run `./test_std`.
